# game-node-web
The repository for the web client of Game Node. This is our main site, the one you see at [gamenode.app](https://gamenode.app).


## Contributing
### Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. Run `yarn` in the root directory of the repository
4. Run `yarn dev:all` to start the development server (and the typesafe-i18n server!)
5. Check your instance at `http://localhost:3000`

### Setting up your environment
1. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project
2. Copy the contents of `.env.local.example`
3. **Alternatively**, just run `cp .env.local.example .env.local`  

If you are developing **exclusively** for the web client, you don't need to host your own instance of GameNode. You can instead just point your local client to our server:
1. Replace all instances of `localhost:9000` with `search.gamenode.app`
2. Replace all instances of `localhost:5000` with `server.gamenode.app`

If you need to make changes to any of the backend systems, please refer to their respective repositories on instructions on how to set them up.   
Feel free to reach out to us through Discord to get help setting everything up! Alternatively, open an issue and we will try our best to help.
