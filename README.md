# game-node-web
The repository for the web client of Game Node.

## Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. Run `yarn` in the root directory of the repository
4. Run `yarn dev:all` to start the development server (and the typesafe-i18n server!)
5. Check your instance at `http://localhost:3000`

Start working ;)

## Important
You need to have a GameNode server instance running on your machine to actually use the app.
After setting it up, set your `.env.local` file. You can find an example in the `.env.local.example` file.  
You can also set the environment variables in your system.
